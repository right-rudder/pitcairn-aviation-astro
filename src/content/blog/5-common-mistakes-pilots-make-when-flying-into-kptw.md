Flying into Heritage Field Airport (KPTW) can be straightforward, but even experienced pilots occasionally make mistakes. Pitcairn Aviation highlights the five most common errors and provides guidance to ensure a **safe, stress-free arrival**.

## 1. Inadequate Preflight Planning

Failing to check weather, NOTAMs, or aircraft performance can lead to last-minute surprises. Always plan your route, review airspace restrictions, and prepare for alternate airports if necessary.

## 2. Misjudging Runway and Approach Conditions

KPTW’s single runway (10/28) is well-maintained, but miscalculating approach speeds, crosswinds, or landing distances can be risky. Review approach plates and communicate with ATC early for guidance.

## 3. Ignoring Ground Services

Some pilots overlook available FBO services like fueling, tie-downs, or crew cars. Coordinating with Pitcairn Aviation ensures your aircraft and passengers are cared for efficiently.

## 4. Rushing On the Ramp

High traffic or tight schedules can tempt pilots to rush ground operations. Avoid skipping checklists, and take the time to secure the aircraft, handle fuel properly, and perform safety checks.

## 5. Not Utilizing Local Expertise

Pitcairn Aviation staff are familiar with KPTW’s airspace, weather patterns, and amenities. Not asking for advice or guidance can lead to avoidable errors.

## Final Thoughts

By addressing these common mistakes, pilots can enjoy safer, more efficient flights into KPTW. Pitcairn Aviation is dedicated to supporting pilots with **expert guidance, comprehensive services, and attentive care** on every visit.
