Winter brings unique challenges for pilots flying into Heritage Field Airport (KPTW). Pitcairn Aviation shares essential tips to ensure safe and efficient operations during the colder months.

## 1. Check Weather Conditions Regularly

Monitor METARs, TAFs, and local forecasts for snow, ice, and low visibility. Weather can change rapidly in Pennsylvania winters.

## 2. Preflight Aircraft Preparation

- Verify de-icing systems and fluid levels
- Inspect battery health and engine preheating requirements
- Remove snow or ice from wings, control surfaces, and tires

Winter flights have less daylight, so plan departures and arrivals accordingly. Ensure you have updated charts and lighting references.

- Ensure safe taxiing on icy or snow-covered ramps
- Coordinate with Pitcairn Aviation for guidance and assistance
